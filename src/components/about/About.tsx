        Hi, I’m Atai, a passionate Frontend Developer with a keen eye for detail and a strong
        foundation in JavaScript, React, and modern web technologies.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        With a deep understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, and frameworks like
        React and Redux, I specialize in building intuitive and responsive web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My goal is to continue growing as a developer, eventually stepping into a senior frontend
        role where I can lead projects and mentor others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a degree in Information Systems and Technologies from KNITU-KAI and have completed
        advanced programming courses at &apos;School 21&apos; by Sberbank.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        I am deeply committed to writing clean, maintainable code and believe in the importance of
        continuous learning. Books like &apos;Clean Code &apos; by Robert Martin and &apos;Effective
        TypeScript &apos; by Dan Vanderkam have greatly influenced my development philosophy.
      </p>
